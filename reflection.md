# Reflection Document

## HTML

### Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?

I was able to complete the HTML exercises on my own, but I did refer to the videos to confirm I was doing everything right.

### How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?

I found the exercises to be helpful. I was very unfamiliar with HTML so all of this section was good exposure for me.

### Was there something that you wish had been explained better?

I wish we went more in depth about semantic elements. Or had specific exercises for it.

### Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week’s topic a little better?

Exercises on semantic elements. I still feel a little shaky in that area.

## Accessibility

### Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?

I was able to complete the exercises on my own, and I checked my work with the videos.

### How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?

I found the form exercise to be really helpful because I had never put much thought into accessibility before. It was interesting to learn about, and the discussion activity where we used a screen reader was especially eye-opening.

### Was there something that you wish had been explained better?

Nothing comes to mind.

### Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week’s topic a little better?

Nothing comes to mind.

## CSS

### Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?

Mostly on my own. Where I got stuck I would watch a solution video.

### How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?

I found this section to be very helpful. I found media queries and specificity the most helpful and interesting.

### Was there something that you wish had been explained better?

Maybe overall organization of css files? I always feel like my files become a bit of a mess.

Nothing comes to mind.
